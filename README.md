# Hair-Disease-Prediction
In this project utilizing data science methodologies within a Jupyter Notebook environment, we aim to predict hair diseases leveraging deep learning techniques with Keras and TensorFlow. We will employ an image dataset containing three distinct subsets: training, testing, and validation. The training set will be utilized to train our convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recognize patterns indicative of various hair diseases. The testing set will then evaluate the model's performance on unseen data, ensuring its generalizability. Finally, the validation set will be employed to fine-tune hyperparameters and optimize the model's performance. Through this approach, we endeavor to develop an accurate and robust predictive model capable of identifying hair diseases from images, thus aiding in early diagnosis and treatment.
