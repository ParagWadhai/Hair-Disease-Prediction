# Hair-Disease-Prediction
In the Hair Disease Prediction project, I developed a deep learning model using Transfer Learning with the VGG16 architecture to classify images of hair diseases into predefined categories. The pre-trained VGG16 model was fine-tuned by adding custom dense layers for classification. I processed and augmented the dataset using Keras' ImageDataGenerator to enhance model performance. The model was trained on a labeled dataset of hair disease images, with metrics like accuracy and loss monitored during training. Finally, I evaluated the model's performance on test data, achieving accurate classification and saving the results for further analysis.
